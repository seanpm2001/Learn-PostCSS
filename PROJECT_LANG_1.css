/* Project language file 1 */
/* For: seanpm2001/Learn-PostCSS */
/* About: */
/* I decided to make PostCSS the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-PostCSS) as PostCSS is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the PostCSS programming language. It only makes sense to PostCSS the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here. */
